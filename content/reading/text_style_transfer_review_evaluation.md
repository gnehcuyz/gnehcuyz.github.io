### Overview
This paper provides a detailed review of the field of text style transfer (TST), which involves modifying the stylistic properties of text while retaining its content. It introduces a taxonomy for TST models, evaluates 19 state-of-the-art TST algorithms on two datasets, and discusses open challenges and future directions.

### Contributions
The paper highlights three key contributions:
1. **Taxonomy and Categorization:** Organizes TST models based on data settings, strategies, and techniques, providing a structured understanding of the field.
2. **Evaluation Methodologies:** Reviews existing metrics and methods for evaluating TST models, emphasizing reproducibility and benchmarking.
3. **Experimental Study:** Benchmarks 19 state-of-the-art TST algorithms on two publicly available datasets, offering insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

### Methodology
#### Taxonomy of TST Models
TST models are categorized into:
- **Data Settings:** Parallel supervised, non-parallel supervised, and purely unsupervised.
- **Strategies:** Style-content disentanglement (explicit, implicit, or without disentanglement).
- **Techniques:** Adversarial learning, back-translation, reinforcement learning, and attribute-controlled generation.

#### Evaluation Metrics
- **Automated Metrics:** BLEU, ROUGE-L, and style transfer accuracy.
- **Human Evaluation:** Measures fluency, content preservation, and style transfer accuracy.

### Experimental Findings
- **Datasets:** Evaluated on Yelp reviews and Caption datasets, focusing on sentiment transfer and stylistic variation.
- **Results:** Models leveraging non-parallel supervised settings showed better performance due to their flexibility and robustness. Adversarial learning and back-translation were particularly effective for preserving content while altering style.

### Implications
The study highlights challenges in TST, such as the lack of standard evaluation metrics and limited datasets for diverse stylistic attributes. Future research directions include:
- Developing more reliable evaluation frameworks.
- Exploring unsupervised and multi-modal approaches for TST.
- Addressing ethical concerns in style transfer applications.
