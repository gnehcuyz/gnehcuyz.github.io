I worked as a Research Assistant in the [Data Security and Privacy Lab](https://leiyucs.github.io), where I worked with [Professor Lei Yu](https://leiyucs.github.io) on privacy vulnerabilities in machine learning and large language models (LLMs). I also conducted research in [Professor Oshani Seneviratne](https://oshani.info)â€™s BRAIN Lab, focusing on label inference attacks in federated learning.

## Projects
- [**Membership Inference Attacks against ML Models**](/research/mia-ml/): Investigated potential privacy risks associated with machine learning models, focusing on data leakage and user privacy concerns.
- [**Membership Inference Attacks against LLMs**](/research/mia-llm/): A natural extension of the previous project, this research delved into the unique challenges posed by large language models, including their capacity to memorize and regurgitate training data.
- [**Label Inference Attacks in Federated Learning**](/research/lia-fl/): Explored vulnerabilities in federated learning frameworks, specifically targeting label inference attacks and their implications for user privacy.

## Responsibilities
- Conducted research on privacy vulnerabilities in ML and LLMs, enhancing understanding of data protection and ethical AI practices.  
- Designed and implemented experiments to evaluate privacy risks, analyze results, and develop methodologies to enhance privacy vulnerability assessments.  
- Performed literature reviews, coded for data analysis and visualization, and contributed to research papers and presentations.
