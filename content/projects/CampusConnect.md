Once we log in, we can see the home page. Since it’s our first time logging in, we’re asked to choose at least 5 categories we’re interested in. These will personalize our experience.

Once we’ve picked a few, we click Next.
Here’s our personalized dashboard. We’re welcomed by name — ‘Welcome UserABC’ — and right away, we can see what’s Trending, like popular posts by other students.

Here’s a post from UserABC titled ‘How to become rich?’ — it’s a typical discussion post. You can Like, Comment, or Edit your own post.
