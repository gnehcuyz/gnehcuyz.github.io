## Description
This project involved simulating an operating system to manage processes and implement CPU scheduling. Through developing and analyzing scheduling algorithms, I deepened my understanding of process management.

## Tech Stack
- C++.

## Contributions
- Developed and optimized four CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, SRT, and RR).
- Conducted comparative analysis to evaluate efficiency using consistent process sets.
- Analyzed performance metrics, including CPU utilization and burst time, and generated detailed statistical summaries to assess scheduling algorithm effectiveness.
