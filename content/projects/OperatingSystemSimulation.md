## Description
- Simulated an operating system to manage processes and implement CPU scheduling.
- Enhanced understanding of process management through algorithmic development and analysis.

## Tech Stack
- C++.

## Contributions
- Developed and optimized four CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, SRT, and RR).
- Conducted comparative analysis to evaluate efficiency using consistent process sets.
- Analyzed performance metrics, including CPU utilization and burst time, and generated detailed statistical summaries to assess scheduling algorithm effectiveness.
