# Hello World!

I’m a Machine Learning Engineer at [HARP Research](https://www.harpresearch.ai), where I help build and improve AI systems for real-world use. Before this, I worked as a Research Assistant in the [Data Security and Privacy Lab](https://leiyucs.github.io) with [Professor Lei Yu](https://leiyucs.github.io), studying privacy risks in machine learning and large language models. I also conducted research in [Professor Oshani Seneviratne](https://oshani.info)’s BRAIN Lab, focusing on label inference attacks in federated learning.

I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Economics. During my time there, I developed a strong foundation in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and full-stack development—skills I’ve applied in both research and production settings. 

I care most about building things that work well in the real world—something clear, useful, and reliable.
Whether it’s a research prototype or a production system, I try to focus on what actually makes an impact: code that’s easy to maintain, systems that can scale, and tools that solve real problems for real people.
