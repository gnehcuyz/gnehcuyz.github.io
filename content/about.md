A recent graduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Economics. My focus has been on **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Software Development**.

I have worked as a Research Assistant in the Data Security and Privacy Lab, studying privacy vulnerabilities in machine learning models and large language models (LLMs). I also gained experience with Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and full-stack development through projects and research.

My goal is to use my skills in machine learning, privacy, and software engineering to solve real-world problems and build technology that helps people.
