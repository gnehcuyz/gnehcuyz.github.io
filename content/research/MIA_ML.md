## Description
- Conducted research on privacy vulnerabilities in machine learning models by implementing membership inference attacks to evaluate reliability and disparities in privacy.
- This work has led to a paper, *Membership Inference Attacks as Privacy Tools: Reliability, Disparity, and Ensemble*, which has been submitted to ***ACM CCS 2025*** and is currently **under review**.
- This project was ongoing for more than a year. I contributed to it from **January 2024** to **January 2025**, focusing on building data pipeline and conducting comprehensive evaluations.

## Tech Stack
- Python, NumPy, Matplotlib.

## Contributions
- Built **data pipelines** for processing attack predictions across multiple seeds.
- Created **visualizations**, including Venn diagrams and upset diagrams, to identify patterns and disparities in attack outcomes.
- Automated **data processing** workflows with Shell Scripts to handle large datasets.
- Calculated metrics such as Jaccard similarity, set variance, and entropy for reliability analysis.
