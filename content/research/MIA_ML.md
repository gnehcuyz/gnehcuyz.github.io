## Description
- Focused on understanding and visualizing membership inference vulnerabilities in machine learning models.

## Tech Stack
- Python, NumPy, Matplotlib.

## Contributions
- Built data pipelines for processing attack predictions across multiple seeds.
- Calculated metrics such as Jaccard similarity, set variance, and entropy for reliability analysis.
- Created visualizations, including Venn diagrams and upset diagrams, to identify patterns and disparities in attack outcomes.
- Automated data processing workflows with Shell Scripts to handle large datasets.
