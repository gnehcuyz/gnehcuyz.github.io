## Description
- Conducted research on privacy vulnerabilities in machine learning models by implementing membership inference attacks to evaluate reliability and disparities in privacy.
- This project was ongoing for more than a year. I contributed to it from **January 2024** to **January 2025**, focusing on building data pipeline and conducting comprehensive evaluations.

## Tech Stack
- Python, NumPy, Matplotlib.

## Contributions
- Built data pipelines for processing attack predictions across multiple seeds.
- Calculated metrics such as Jaccard similarity, set variance, and entropy for reliability analysis.
- Created visualizations, including Venn diagrams and upset diagrams, to identify patterns and disparities in attack outcomes.
- Automated data processing workflows with Shell Scripts to handle large datasets.
