## Description
- Explored label inference attacks in vertical federated learning (VFL) to evaluate the risks of revealing label information during training.

## Tech Stack
- Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Scikit-learn.

## Contributions
- Developed and optimized a label inference attack algorithm in PyTorch.
- Preprocessed and analyzed data to ensure compatibility with federated learning frameworks.
